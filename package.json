  "description": "The Filter panel is a UI element that displays the combined filter. This filter is stored in the filterValue property and consists of filters that users apply in other UI elements (filter row, header filter, filterBuilder).\nTo display the filter panel, set the filterPanel.visible property to true.\nA click on the combined filter calls the integrated filter builder. You can configure it in the filterBuilder object. In this demo, this object is used to add the weekends custom filter operation.\nThe intergrated filter builder is displayed in a pop-up window (the DevExtreme Popup component). Its default configuration is defined automatically, but you can change it in the filterBuilderPopup object. In this example, this object is used to specify the position of the pop-up window.\n",
